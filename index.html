             <p>so sorry to hear, so young, rip. long live the apple. <br> Malik</p> 
             <p>I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i
                have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a
                awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and
                work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow
                by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will
                dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him. <br> <br> Tracy</p> <br> 
                <h3>  Steve Jobs </h3>
                 <p> What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written
                  as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every
                 email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I
                  interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a
                  PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.
                  And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be
                  missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work. <br>

                   <h3>He's gone...</h3>
                  <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I
                    knew him. I will forever remember hirn. I'm still saddened because he was
                    taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly

                 <p>Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs
                    the great leader and creator in the world.I believe he would go to a more
                    beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will remember
                    him forever. <br>

                       <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe
                        my feelings…. For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple
                        products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've
                        been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is
                        connected with Steve, I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a
                        genius. <br>

                         respect for Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, IPod, and iPad off for one
                         hour. May Steve rest in peace. <br>
